# Best Professors Ranking using AHP Method
This repository contains a Python implementation of the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method specifically designed for ranking and evaluating professors based on multiple criteria. The AHP method is a widely-used decision-making technique that helps identify and prioritize alternatives by comparing their relative importance within a hierarchical structure.

# What is AHP?
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a decision-making method that allows for the systematic evaluation and prioritization of alternatives based on multiple criteria. AHP breaks down complex decision problems into a hierarchical structure and uses pairwise comparisons to determine the relative importance of criteria and alternatives. By assigning weights to different criteria, AHP provides a ranking order that helps identify the best alternatives.

# About this Repository
This repository contains the following components:

AHP_Exercise.py: The main Python script that implements the AHP method for ranking professors. It utilizes the AHP algorithm to process input data, conduct pairwise comparisons, calculate criteria weights, and generate a ranked list of professors based on their performance.

README.md: The documentation file that provides detailed instructions on how to use the AHP implementation for ranking professors. It includes information on input data format, conducting pairwise comparisons, interpreting the results, and modifying the script to suit your specific requirements.

Getting Started
To use this AHP implementation for ranking professors, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

Install the required dependencies, if any, mentioned in the README.md file.

Open the AHP_Exercise.py script and modify any necessary parameters or settings according to your requirements.

Run the ahp.py script using Python. The script will process the input data, conduct pairwise comparisons, calculate criteria weights, and generate a ranked list of professors based on their performance.

Review the results and interpret the output to identify the best professors based on the given criteria.

Contributions and Issues
Contributions to enhance the functionality, performance, or usability of this AHP implementation for professor ranking are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the repository's GitHub page.

Enjoy using the AHP method to identify the best professors in your evaluation process!
